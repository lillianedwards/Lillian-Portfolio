          Greetings! I'm Lillian, a new Duluth-based front-end developer. I love the UI/UX side of things, but I have a knack for making things work. I can't give up JavaScript, there's still so much to learn!

          <h4 className='aboutMe'>
          I bring collaboration skills, a user-centric perspective, and information architecture proficiency from my previous career as a classroom teacher. I can also make up a song about almost anything, thank you Kindergarten!

          When I'm not coding, or on Figma, I'm in a hot yoga class, trying out a new recipe, or reading a good historical-fiction novel. Thanks for taking a peek around here, I'm happy to have you! ðŸ¦‹
