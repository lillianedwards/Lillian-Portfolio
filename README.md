# Refactored Portfolio

## Description

A crucial piece of a web developer's career materials is their portfolio. It not only exhibits their work and projects they've completed but also serves as a representation of their design personality and aesthetic. Unless clients are allowing web devs to design projects with their own tastes and choices, it's also one of the only contexts where web devs can completely control colors, fonts, and layouts to fit their preferences. This portfolio is a representation of me and the design vibes I've been loving, as well as an expo of projects I've completed. 🪩

### Technical Work

📐 One page application using React and react-router-dom to navigate through different components, i.e, "pages".
📐The resume link in the navigation bar links to a png of my resume and also a downloadable document.
📐Nav Links use framer-motion to float in from the top of the viewport upon initial page load and refresh. 
📐Footer icons, from Bootstrap Icons, take users to external sites and use framer-motion to expand upon hover.
📐 Contact form requires users to fill out every field before they can submit a message, the contact form uses emailjs to send the message to my personal email. 

### Design

🎨 Beige's, and browns have been incredibly popular in product and UI design. I love the calm, neutral look and thinks it makes the site very accessible and increases usability. 
🎨 The highlight color of blue is used to further contribute to the content, calm feeling I hope to convey to users. 
🎨 Text and box-shadows are used throughout on elements and text on pages to give a little more dimension to the site. 
🎨 When brands or designers design a logo, it's often meant to be the "signature" of their product. My signature acts as the logo of my portfolio giving a personal, yet elegant feeling to the nav bar.
